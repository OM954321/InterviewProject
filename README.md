To run this project: First open this project in any IDE (netbeans, Eclipse or Intellij) you want. 
Second thing is I have added the Libraries folder in it, Add all libraries in the projects. 
Third in SignUp and SignIn Class, there is a @BeforeTest Method in which I am initializing the driver. 
I have created a Folder called 'Drivers' in the project. Get the path of that folder and replace it in both classes


Why did you choose the framework that you chose? 
Answer: I did not use any framework in this assignment because of time constraints. If I had the time, I could use the Page Object Model and also implement the Data-Driven Functionality by which I am passing the Test Data from an external xml, csv or xlsx file.

What challenges did you face during this exercise? 
Answer: The only challenge that I faced while writing the scripts was time, because I have to find external libraries from internet then have to add them in project. Other than that everything I had no issues.
